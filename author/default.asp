						<p>
							I had a major setback in my thirties. Some might call it a breakdown; others might call it depression. It was a setback that lasted six months. Before that, I had always soared through life and I enjoyed engaging with friends, family and making people happy. Sales and human interaction businesses suited me.
						</p>
						<p>
							I owned my first business at twenty-five and began to run other companies, while simultaneously building my own large companies and without realizing it, became mentally fatigued. Everything fell apart.  My mental health, physical health, a long-term relationship, my work, even my own businesses – it went downhill all at once.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								During those six months I could not function. I shut down a thriving business, my long-term relationship ended, and I basically became a recluse. The upside to this was that it gave me time to think, and think very hard. How and why had I ended up this way? I was travelling a great deal and, by most people’s definition, I was successful.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							I discovered that the mind is the most powerful tool we have. When we connect with our mind it opens us up to the paths we can choose to take in life and what we do. Simply put, what the mind chooses to see, to embrace, colours the actions we take and what we attract into our lives. Success is not the bottom line. Success comes about by way of an effective balance of faith, family, community, and work.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my case, I was extremely motivated and driven to uncover how I had derailed. I set out on a new journey, to find out why. I rebuilt myself mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and changed my mindset. I became fascinated by successful people and what makes them stay successful. I started to research and have never stopped researching the secrets to success. SUCCESS1010™ is the fruit of 10 years of research.
