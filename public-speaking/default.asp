          <p> Research indicates that inherited or genetically derived happiness accounts for nearly half of our experience. The remaining half stems from a combination of our values and the events that comprise our individual lives. Interestingly, the happiness experienced due to life events, such as being offered a dream job, meeting the ideal romantic partner, or achieving a long-term goal, is only short-lived.  We return to our baseline level of happiness not long after these life events occur. By putting in place a firm set of values for ourselves, we contribute to the degree of happiness we experience. This experience of happiness is both enduring and stable. </p>
