          <p> SUCCESS1010™ FOR LIVING is a guide to living your most successful life. I had a major set back in my thirties. Throughout this journey I became extremely motivated and driven to uncover why I had derailed. This book is a result of years of research and personal experience. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> I discovered that establishing and following a set of personal values leads to lasting experience of happiness. ‘‘Success1010TM stems from the 10 Blockages we face and the way to unblock ourselves along with the 10 principles we need to stay successful. Achieving your goals is based around the pursuit of the four basic values: faith, family, community, and work. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> ‘When we are stuck in life, we feel emotionally drained and life looks doomed. From where do these feelings arise? Often, they derive from our traumatic interpretation of early childhood events. This interpretation is unconscious, as is the way we learnt to cope with it. These events and how we learn to cope with them shape our lives, impacting our future. </p>

        <h2 class="text-light mt-50 mb-50 "> WHAT IS A STUCKBURY®? </h2>
        <p class="text-light "> Stuckburies® are the unresolved emotional complexes or emotional baggage buried deep within us which inhibits us from giving our best shot at achieving success. A Stuckbury® is formed early on in life, typically from infancy through to age seven, but they can form whilst in the womb and beyond seven years of age. The Stuckbury® stays with us, in our unconscious mind, as we approach adulthood. In adulthood, as we face new experiences, the Stuckbury® causes us to unconsciously expect things to be traumatic, just as they were when we were young. We treat new life experiences as though they, too, will turn out the way past childhood experiences did. This is how the Stuckbury® influences our adult behaviour; we apply our old childhood coping strategies to our new experiences in life. </p>

        <h2 class="text-light mt-50 mb-50"> MOVING FORWARD </h2>
        <p class="text-light "> We can all start the day with a fresh approach. We can all start a new diet to be healthier; we can all go to a motivational seminar ready to start a new life. But what happens a few days, weeks, or possibly months later is that we stop. We fail to commit long term to our goals. So, why don’t we continue? </p>
        <p class="text-light"> The answer stems from our blockages, and blockages start in childhood. This book is designed to help you uncover the hidden traumatic events of your past that shape your life and may well have caused blockages. These events impact you, yet stay hidden for decades. When they surface and develop in our lives, they subject us to a continual cycle of painful relationships, doubts, fears, and uncertainty. </p>
